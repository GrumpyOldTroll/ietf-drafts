       <t>
This document describes a BGP-based method to communicate source IP reverse-path reachability for sources of multicast IP traffic which is available via AMT (RFC 7450).

This document defines a new SAFI (Subsequent Address Family Identifier) Parameter type for MBGP which declares the next hop for RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding) of a source IP to be the AMT tunnel discovered via an explicitly provided anycast IP address for AMT Relay Discovery.

   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>
       AMT <xref target="RFC7450" /> provides a way to forward multicast
       traffic from an AMT relay in a multicast-capable domain to an AMT gateway in a different multicast-capable domain over a unicast-only network.
     </t>
     <t>
       AMT also defines a well-known anycast address for relay discovery. However, a relay needs to have multicast connectivity sufficient to receive traffic from a source in order to forward traffic from that source. In some cases, multicast traffic sources may not have multicast connectivity to a relay which can be discovered by a gateway using the well-known address. This issue is described in more detail in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mboned-interdomain-peering-bcp" />, sections 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5.
     </t>
     <t>
       A service provider may provide multicast traffic and also provide
       AMT relays that can receive their multicast traffic and forward it
       to AMT gateways, but the AMT gateways in receving networks need a
       way to discover an appropriate AMT relay for the sources of IP multicast channels with subscribers in that network.
     </t>
     <t>This document defines such
       a mechanism by using BGP with Multiprotocol Extensions
       <xref target="RFC4760" />, with a new NLRI (Network Layer
       Reachability Information), described in <xref target="source_adv" />.
     </t>
     <t>
       Although it is also possible to provide multicast connectivity between
       domains via a GRE tunnel protected with IPSEC, and although a BGP
       connection between domains is likely to operate over such a tunnel,
       the service provider has more flexibility in load balancing and
       automated distribution of multicast traffic-forwarding responsibilities
       among different forwarders by using AMT instead of using the same GRE tunnel that communicates the routing information.

   <section title="Multicast Source Reachability" anchor="source_adv">
     <t>
       This document defines a new NLRI called the "Multicast Source over AMT" NLRI. The Multicast Source over AMT NLRI is carried in BGP <xref target="RFC4271" /> using BGP Multiprotocol Extensions <xref target="RFC4760" /> with an Address Family Identifier (AFI) of 1 or 2 and a Subsequent AFI (SAFI) of TBD1.
     </t>
     <t>
       The following is the format of the Multicast Source over AMT NLRI:

     </figure>

     <!-- jholland 2017-12-04: language here follows example from https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6514#section-4 -->
     <t>
       The value of the AFI field in the MP_REACH_NLRI/MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute that carries the Multicast Source over AMT NLRI determines whether the source route is IPv4 or IPv6. The value of the Relay-AFI field in the Multicast Source over AMT NLRI indicates whether the Relay Discovery Address is IPv4 or IPv6. (AFI 1 indicates IPv4, AFI 2 indicates IPv6.)
     </t>
     <t>
       The route for the source address MUST NOT be added to any unicast RIB (Routing Information Base) as a result of processing this NLRI. The route SHOULD be added to MRIBs (Multicast Routing Information Bases) as appropriate according to the BGP peering configuration.
     </t>
     <t>
       In order for two BGP speakers to exchange labeled Multicast Source over AMT NLRIs, they MUST use a BGP Capabilities Advertisement to ensure that they both are capable of properly processing such an NLRI. This is done as specified in <xref target="RFC4760" /> by using capability code 1 (multiprotocol BGP) with an AFI of 1 or 2 and a SAFI of TBD1.

     <t>

         IANA has assigned the SAFI Value TBD1 from the SAFI Value registry
         defined in Section 9 of <xref target="RFC4760">RFC&nbsp;4760</xref>,
         to denote the new NLRI defined in <xref target="source_adv" /> of this document.
     </t>
     <t>
       [TO BE REMOVED: 
        During experimental development, the private value 242 from that registry will be used in our implementation.
     </t>
     <t>
        This registration should take place at the following location:

   <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
       <t>
           The behavior defined in this document will cause an AMT Gateway
           to open new tunnels to IP addresses specified by an external AS.
           As such, this has the same security considerations as section 6.2
           and section 6.3 of <xref target="RFC7450" />, in addition to the
           usual security implications of running the underlying BGP, as
           described in <xref target="RFC4271" /> and <xref target="RFC4272" />.
       </t>
       <t>
           It is RECOMMENDED that implementations provide a configurable limit on the
           number of unique AMT Relay Discovery IPs.
